Simply Deactivate the plugin== Frequently Asked Questions === Why do I have a blank index.html file in each folder of this plugin =this is simply to prevent anyone from direct linking aka indexing your plugins directories & folders. if you wish & know how to do so. You could simply use your webhosting controls to adjust indexing on your site.= How does the Backup Browser Function =Backup browser is a simple tool for viewing your current backups, downloading them or removing them.= How does E-Mailing the Backup as an Attachment Work =With the attachments addon you can e-mail A copy of your created backup as an attachment with the alerts e-mails. This addon only costs 5.00 via paypal.= How does the Automatic Scheduling work =This Addon can be purchased & used to setup automatic creation of your backups. You can purchase one of two options for scheduling backups. For those webhosts that allow the use of Cron Jobs you can purchase the cron jobs addon to schedule backups. If you cannot use cron jobs with your webhost then consider purchasing the WP Scheduling addon. With one of these two options you should be able to easily schedule your backup creation.= Why are the addons being sold instead of included freely =Like everyone I have bills to pay and a family to support. Since most users do not donate to support the development of plugins. I am now forced to charge for additional features.== Changelog === 8.0.2 =*Skipped a few to version 8.0.2 to tighten security further on the backup storage directory. Moved backup storage directory to outside webroot directory. This is now a forced change and is not customizabl by end users= 7.0.8 =*Adjusted backup routine for further compatibility and tigher security with different hosts and environments= 7.0.7 =*Fixed cosmetic bug that annoyed me on settings page.= 7.0.6 =*Fixed addon routine to be more compatible with other webhosts.= 7.0.5 =*Fixed slight issue with log viewing during backup creation.
